In the tower's control room, CodeStar faced Glitchmaster. The room was filled with blinking lights, tall servers, and humming machines. As sparks flew and screens flickered, CodeStar quickly typed commands on a glowing keyboard, lines of code appearing like magic to counter the malicious virus.

Glitchmaster laughed menacingly, "You think you can stop me with just some code?" But CodeStar remained calm, their fingers dancing over the keys. With a final keystroke, the virus was neutralized, and the city's systems were restored.

As the control room's lights stabilized and systems rebooted, CodeStar turned to Glitchmaster, who had been trapped in their own coding trap. "coding is a powerful tool, one that can build and protect," CodeStar proclaimed.

From that day on, Technopolis thrived, and CodeStar became a symbol of hope, inspiring others to learn the art of coding. And Alex? Alex knew they had unlocked a power that was truly extraordinary.
