In the bustling city of Technopolis, there lived a young superhero named CodeStar. By day, CodeStar was simply known as Alex, a curious teenager with a love for gadgets. By night, Alex transformed into CodeStar, using their extraordinary skills to keep the city safe from tech-savvy villains.

One sunny afternoon, while exploring an old library, Alex stumbled upon a dusty book titled "The Art of Coding." Intrigued, Alex began to read and soon discovered that coding was like a superpower of its own. Eager to harness this new power, Alex started learning different languages, from Python to JavaScript.

But soon enough, Technopolis faced a dire threat. The malevolent hacker known as Glitchmaster had unleashed a virus that threatened the city's mainframe. Without hesitation, CodeStar suited up and raced to the Technopolis Tower, where the mainframe was housed.
