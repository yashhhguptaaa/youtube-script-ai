Once upon a time, in a small town teeming with lush green trees and colorful flowers, there lived a curious boy named Harry. Harry had wild, curly brown hair and bright blue eyes that sparkled with curiosity. His rosy cheeks and freckled nose always seemed to reflect his lively spirit. Harry wore glasses that were almost as big as his face, giving him a wise and wizardly appearance. He loved wearing his favorite hoodie, which had a picture of a dragon breathing fire.

Harry wasn't like most kids. Instead of playing outside all day, he found joy in staying inside and tapping away on his computer keyboard. You see, Harry loved to code. Every day after school, he would rush home, drop his backpack on the floor, and sit in front of his sleek black laptop. His room was filled with posters of robots, spaceships, and endless numbers. His desk was cluttered with gadgets, cables, and thick books about coding, glowing under the soft light of his desk lamp.
